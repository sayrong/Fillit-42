**Introduction**

Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possi- bilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.
A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.

**For compile:**
```
make all
```

**For dellite all obj and executable files:**
```
make  fclean
```


**Example**

From file with:
```
....
....
###.
.#..

....
....
..##
.##.

....
.##.
.##.
....

....
.#..

....
.##.
.#..
.#..

.#..
##..
.#..
....

....
###.
..#.
....

..#.
..##
...#
....

```

You will get the smallest square of pieces: 
```
AAABB.
HABBEE
HHCCE.
.HCCEF
DGGGFF
DDDG.F

```
